    Scientific innovations or technology is the most amazing thing that has ever happened to humankind. In this modern world, technology is no more a luxury; it has become a necessity. Life without technology is next to impossible since humans have become dependent on technological advancements. For every human activity, we need a machine, and then there comes technology. It has made all our lives easier and more convenient and has also made transportation, education, labour, etc., more accessible. Technological breakthroughs change from time to time in today’s fast-paced, ever-changing world. However, in today’s world, technology plays a critical role in strengthening a country’s economy and people’s lives. We are all surrounded by technology from all corners. From waking up in the morning till we sleep, in some way or the other, we need technology. Technology, our new present and future, is making human lives easier and more convenient. With new technological innovations, human beings have become more dependent on science and technology. We rely on technology for all our activities, and have become an integral part of our lives. The entire civilization has become reliant on the modern technology it employs. Life and business would come to a halt without technology. It is beneficial to society, but it must be handled cautiously. It is helpful, and at the same time, it is harmful. It has reduced man’s labour and improved the productivity of the work, but it has also reduced employment at the same time. So, technology should be used only to a certain extent by not depending on it completely. From the moment we open our eyes, we are surrounded by technology. The fans, lights, televisions, computers, induction stoves, etc. It is just not possible to move a step further without using technology. There was a time when people used to wait for months to receive a letter from their close ones. But now, we all are just a click away. If you are missing someone, you just have to click once for a video call or text message. The cost has also reduced with time. If you crave a piece of cake, then the microwave is the solution. If you are tired and unable to wash utensils, then a dishwasher is the solution. If you want to party, then the music system is the solution. Technology is the ultimate solution to every problem that a human being is facing, and scientists are so alert about the same that they come up with new and innovative solutions to every problem. It is, however, important that you do not completely rely on technology.
Technology has become a vital part of our daily lives since we rely on it for all of our activities. The use of contemporary technology has made the entire civilization dependent. Without technology, life and commerce would grind to a halt. Technology has a positive impact on society, but it must be managed with caution. It is both beneficial and detrimental.  Technology is the most useful form of science for the general population. In simple words, technology is when we take the concepts of science and transform them into gadgets and devices that are useful to us as human beings. When we look around us, almost everything is a result of or a form of technology.

For example, the device you are using right now is a form of technology made for communication, or the refrigerator in your kitchen is a use of science that helps to keep your food fresh and cool. With these examples, we see how dependent we are on technology and how important it is for us in our daily lives.

It isn’t easy to imagine our lives without using any form of technology. For the smallest of communications, we tend to turn to our mobile phones. Even most of the food we eat is packaged in factories using various technologies. Thus, imagining a life without technology is impossible. It is not only a fact of life but also a necessity for all of us.

In fact, the smartphone, that is, a mobile phone which can connect to the internet, is becoming one of the fastest-growing and most accessible forms of technology around the world. On a smartphone, you can click photographs, browse the internet, listen to music, and use social media. With the advent of smartphone technology, the practical purpose of not only communicating with your friends is met, but also so many others, as mentioned.

Thus, in today’s world, the importance of technology becomes more and more as the years pass. Scientists have done so much to advance humans using technology, and we still have a long way to go.
